            <h4><strong>Biography</strong></strong></h4>
            <p>Livingstone wasn't known for his great record. He was known for his great moment and 
                tremendous heart in the ring.  He became the first world champion from Saint Kitts and Nevis.
                His ascent to his fights with Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini led to his great moment. After this, he would
                lose his title and become sort of a gate keeper for the lightweight division. This led him to be
                both a dangerous opponent with every win being earned for his opponents.
            </p>
            <p>Livingstone followed his career by becoming a marathon runner. He signs autographs and tries
                to live a healthy lifestyle.
